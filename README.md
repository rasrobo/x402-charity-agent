## 📚 Simple Explanation (5th Grade Level)

### What is x402? 🤖💵
**x402 is like a robot that can send money automatically.**
- **Normally:** Click buttons on your phone → send money
- **With x402:** Tell a robot "Send $10 to charity every month" → it happens automatically
- **Like autopay, but for crypto.**

### What is the Charity Agent? 🤖❤️
A **chatbot (like Siri or Alexa) that helps raise money for good causes**.

**How it works:**
1. You text a robot (like texting a friend)
2. Robot tells you about a charity ("We're helping feed hungry kids!")
3. You say "I want to help!"
4. Robot sends your donation automatically (no forms to fill out)
5. You can check the robot's wallet to make sure it's real (not a fake)
